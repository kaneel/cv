Ten years+ in web and web app front-end development.<br />
Started as a junior in a parisian startup, working mostly with PHP, HTML and CSS, and quickly moved into frontend development.<br />
Been working on many different projects: startup, e-commerce, brand blogs and luxury websites.<br />

During these first years, I learnt the importance of writing __semantic markup__ and how to organise the __CSS__ accordingly.

Somewhere in the middle of 2011, after some years working with Javascript with the help of __jQuery__ for any _DOM_ and _AJAX_ related operations, I started to get more and more interested in developing better UI using better __design patterns__.<br/>
Since then, I did several prototypes, fiddled a lot with __lazy-loaded__ assets, __responsive__ grids as well as __adaptive rendering__ of components, most often using vanilla Javascript and CSS, sometimes with the help of some __libraries, frameworks and preprocessors__â€¦<br />
My code is modular, loosely coupled, reusable and commented and my good understanding of Javascript allows me to be creative in the way I solve problems.

I like to try and tweak, to prototype and make, to experiment, fail and bounce back with more ideas.<br />
I like to discuss habits and question the way I code and I fancy being a part of a team that challenge and question me.<br />

In every team I've been a part of, I always put __discussions__ at the center and always extend the discussion to the other actors of a project; I strongly believe working on a product is a team-work involving different people and where the meaning of the product must be central (and what better than front-end for being central, interacting with product owners, designers and backend developers!)

I fancy working on creative projects that require different people from different fields.<br />

I now live in London and I am currently looking for new opportunities to learn more and work on beautiful and creative projects!<br />
Don't hesitate to get in touch!<br />
